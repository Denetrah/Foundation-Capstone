Subway is going all out for its news Subway Series, a lineup of 12 signature sandwiches. Just a handful of days after Subway gave away close to one million sandwiches, the chain has yet another wild promotion up its sleeveâ€”or in this case, it is a sleeve.

On August 27, at Las Vegas' Bad Apple Tattoo, Subway will host a block party where nine Subway superfans will be able to receive a tattoo of the Subway Series logo by two-time Ink Master champion DJ Tambe or a member of his team. Depending on where the sandwich fanatics receive the tattoo and how big it is, they'll be able to receive free Subway sandwiches for a month, a year, or even a lifetime.

To get free subs for their entire life, a Subway fan will have to receive a 12" x 12" tattoo of the logo on their sternum or back. A 2" x 2" tattoo on their wrist, bicep, or foot will win free subs for a month, and a 3" x 3" tattoo on their shoulder blade, forearm, or calf will win free subs for a year.

If you prefer a not-so-permanent way to show your love for Subway, airbrush tattoos will also be available at the event. Being a true block party, there will be free Subway sandwiches, a DJ, dance floor, and a graffiti artist on hand to create a mural. All the details can be found here.
